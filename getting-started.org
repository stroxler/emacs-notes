This doc focuses on how to survive in a bare emacs session with no config,
especially for folks like me whose normal setup is far-removed from bare emacs
(e.g. any evil user would tend to rely on vim commands.

I got much of this material from [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48JlgiBpw_I&list=PLEoMzSkcN8oPZvSdewHG8uApD7THlLLCV][System Crafters Beginner's Guide]] and the
two following videos on basic navigation.

Launching emacs
* For GUI emacs on OSX, you want `emacs &`
* For terminal emacs, in a setting where GUI is the default, use `emacs -nw`


Livable UI using the bare (OSX) emacs install:
* I find the default colors painful to stare at. You can use =M-x custom-themes= to explore color themes 
* I like misterioso, you can use =M-x load-theme \ misterioso= to pull it up
* =M-x tool-bar-mode= will hide the toolbar

M-x lets you run commands
* Important tip: you can tab complete on any partial match to command name
* e.g. M-x -regionTAB will give you all the commands that work on regions

Absolute bare survival
* In general, M-x is how you run arbitrary commands by name; this is handy if you usually rely on custom keybindings.
* C-g will exit a partially-complete command. Just hit it many times if you find yourself somewhere weird.
* M-x customize will take you to a GUI for customizing basic settings. Not useful for a real setup, but maybe as a one-off in a bare emacs.

Vim user survival - escape does confusing things by default:
* This may help vim users: =(global-set-key (kbd "<escape>") 'keyboard-escape-quit)=
* You can run it manually with =M-x global-set-key \ ESCAPE \ keyboard-escape-quit=


Most basic file commands:
* C-x C-f to load a file
* C-x C-d to look at a directory (in dired)
* C-x C-c to exit (it will prompt you to save all files)
* C-x C-s to save file

Most basic buffer commands:
* C-x b lets you switch to a buffer by name, with tab completion
* C-x C-b lets you select a buffer to open from a listing in the minibuffer
* C-x LEFT, C-x RIGHT let you cycle through buffers

Basic navigation
* C-a, C-e should be familiar
* C-s, C-r do forward, reverse incremental search (repeat it to iterate)
** Note: this replaces both "big" and "line" style search from vim
* in general, f = forward, b = backward, n = next, p = previous
* M-f / M-b moves forward/backward one word at a time
* M-{ / M-} (with shift) let you move a "paragraph" (mode-dependent) at a time
* M-a / M-e move by expression; in practice this is often nicer than paragraphs
* C-n / C-p goes to next/previous line (but I usually use arrows)
* M-< / M-> jump to top/bottom of buffer (yes, the shift is necessary)
* M-g M-g to go to line (use M-x display-line-numbers-mode)

Basic editing
* C-a C-k and then C-y is handy for moving lines around
* C-x u OR C-/ is undo, *very* important if you are not used to a set of keybindings!

Scrolling
* PGUP and PGDN work fine
* C-l will do point-based scrolling, you can cycle it. C-M-l is also useful

Mark handling
* C-SPC / C-@ both set the mark
* C-x C-x is exchange-point-and-mark 
* many commands act on whatever lives between mark and point (cursor)
* e.g. C-w kills the selection, M-w just copies it into the kill ring
* The mark ring consists of deactivated marks (e.g. C-SPC C-SPC
* You can pop from the mark ring with C-u C-SPC
** Popping rotates the ring, it doesn't delete the top element
* There are many other ways to select groupings. Some particular examples:
** M-h selects paragraph, repeating it selects more moving down
** M-C-h will select the current paragrah and one above

The kill ring
* Kills also go into a ring (like marks)
* C-y yanks the most recent killed snippet
* But running M-y immediately after C-y will rotate through kill ring

Getting help:
* if you want help and aren't sure which function to use, do M-x describe-TAB!
* C-h C-h pulls up general help
* C-h k will let you type a key sequence and tell you what it binds to
* <PREFIX> C-h finds all bindings after PREFIX (e.g. C-x C-h)


Terminology:
* frame = a system window. Normally frames share the same editor session
* window = a pane in a frame
* buffer = a block of text, usually tied to a file but not always
* minibuffer = the special tiny buffer at the bottom of the screen, used by commands
* major mode = the one "basic" mode used at a time for a buffer
* minor mode = one of many possible extensions. By default, applied per buffer but can be global.
* M-f / M-b moves forward/backward one word at a time
* kill means delete, kill ring is stuff deleted or copied. Yank is paste.

Modifier keys in symbols:
* C = control
* M = meta (option)
* S = shift
* s = super (windows / command)
