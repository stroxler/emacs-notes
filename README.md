# Emacs Notes

This will be a collection of Markdown and probably eventually
org-mode notes on using emacs.

## Why?

I've decided I need to get back into emacs - for a couple years
now I've mostly worked in VSCode because of company tooling, but
I'm hitting some cases where the company tools don't work well
for open-source work I need to do.

My previous foray into emacs was via spacemacs which did work
well as a vim user. But I'm convinced that
- I need at least some experience in emacs from scratch to
  competently use emacs in the long-term.
- In light of ^, it's probably a better fit to eventually
  settle on emacs doom if I'm going to use a distribution,
  since doom is supposed to be a bit lighter-weight than
  spacemacs.
